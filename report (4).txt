Password Strength Evaluation Report

1. Passwords Tested:
   a) password123 → Weak (Score: 20%)
      - Lacks symbols, too common.
   b) P@ssw0rd!2025 → Strong (Score: 85%)
      - Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and good length.
   c) Qx9#rT7$Lm2v → Very Strong (Score: 95%)
      - High complexity, random sequence.

2. Feedback from Tool:
   - Short or common passwords scored low.
   - Adding symbols, numbers, and mixed cases improved strength.
   - Length above 12 characters significantly improved results.

3. Best Practices for Strong Passwords:
   - Use at least 12–16 characters.
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
   - Avoid dictionary words or predictable sequences.
   - Consider using a passphrase made of unrelated words.

4. Common Password Attacks:
   - **Brute Force**: Trying all possible combinations.
   - **Dictionary Attack**: Using a list of common words/passwords.
   - **Phishing**: Tricking users into revealing passwords.

5. How Complexity Affects Security:
   - More complexity increases time required for brute-force attacks.
   - Random, long passwords are significantly harder to crack.
   - Avoiding predictable patterns prevents easy dictionary attacks.

Outcome: Understanding of password creation strategies and awareness of attack methods.
